# Changelog

## v1.6.1 (27/3/2025) \[Java 1.13 - 1.21 & Bedrock; Male Variant Only] \[NuruddinPlays]

* Tweaked most of the leggings (Seluar) trim textures to make them still somewhat visible underneath the Samping

## v1.6 (15/2/2025) \[Java 1.6 - 1.21 & Bedrock] \[NuruddinPlays]

* Changed the texture of empty slot icons for all armor pieces into their respective replacements; eg. Helmet becomes Tengkolok for the male variant and Gandik for the female variant
* Added support for armor trims (only for chestplate, leggings and boots replacements)
  * The trims for helmet replacements are still invisible due to the vastly different shape of the replacement's textures for each material types
  * \[Java] Since there is still no support for custom armor trim texture via CIT, some oddities may occur when changing the armor type via CIT to the opposite variant's counterpart
    * For example: Using the female variant, changing from the Kasut to Samping (of the male variant) may cause some random floating pixels around what used to be the Kasut, when there's nothing there when it's a Samping
* Added more strings to the language files to replace any mentions of armor pieces and related texts
* Renamed `Baju` to `Baju Melayu`
* Renamed `Seluar` to `Seluar Melayu`
* Renamed `Chain` armors to `Chainmail` armors

* \[Java] Added a credits file in the zip files
* \[Bedrock] Bumped version number to v1.6 to match the Java pack's version

  * Also used for when you also use the Senjata Melayu resource pack and have this pack above it to properly change all the icons in the smithing table

* Resized all pack icons from 1080x1080 to 512x512 to reduce file size
