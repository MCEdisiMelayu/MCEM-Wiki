# Changelog

## v1.3 (31/8/2024) \[Java 1.7 - 1.21 & Bedrock]

* Changed the keris texture to the new one, thanks to flurrry for the base texture
* Changed the machete texture to remove the gold patches on the handles
* Updated the pack icon
* Updated the credits file

## v1.2 (15/12/2023) \[Java 1.7-1.20]

* Initial Modrinth release!
* Added 1.20 support
* Removed the `ms_arab_my` language file, as it was no longer used by the JawiCraft Language Pack (which now uses `zlm_arab` instead, which is what is used in-game in 1.19+ versions)
* Added `en_gb`/`en_GB` language files (which is basically a copy of `en_us`/`en_US`)
* \[Pre-1.13] Fixed a not so obvious oversight, which makes the machetes and kerises didn't show up in-game at all
  * The folder for the item textures is mistakenly named _item_ (as it is in 1.13+ packs), not _items_ (as intended for pre-1.13 packs)
    * But it actually works for me somehow, maybe I already fixed it, **but only for my copy of the pack**... I'm so sorry for that blunder
  * Now for anyone that want to use this pack in versions like 1.8 or 1.12, go ahead! It should work as intended now! (hopefully)
* \[Pre-1.13] Added support for Jawi translations (via the JawiCraft Language Pack)

## v1.1.1 Hotfix (16/1/2023) \[Bedrock Only]

* Fixed an error in the pack's UUID

## v1.1 (5/1/2023) \[Java 1.7-1.19 & Bedrock]

* Changed the pack name to Senjata Melayu
* Added machetes/parang, which replace axes
* Credits are updated a bit, to add the credit for the machete idea

## v1.0 (2/9/2022) \[Java 1.7-1.19 & Bedrock]

* Initial release
* Pack is currently known as Keris Melayu
* Swords are changed to Keris
