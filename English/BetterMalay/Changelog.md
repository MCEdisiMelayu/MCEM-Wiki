# v1.1 (1/5/2024) [1.6 - 1.20]
- First release of 2024!
- Version listing for the following Minecraft versions is heavily simplified; to reflect the simplification happened with the JawiCraft project
  - The 1.6 & 1.7-1.8 packs have been merged into **1.6-1.8** pack; the 1.13-1.14, 1.15-1.16 and 1.17-1.19 packs all have been merged into a single **1.13-1.19** pack
    - The resource pack icon has been updated for the 1.13-1.19 pack, with a cameo appearance from EmpAhmadK, who helped a ton during the development of JawiCraft!
  - This is done to make the updating process in the future easier, especially when counting the pre-1.13 packs
  - When loading up the pack in versions 1.13-1.18, ignore the warning given, as it should've worked regardless
- Updated lots of translations, which can be seen in full [here](https://github.com/Minecraft-EdisiMelayu/MCEM-Wiki/wiki/Terjemahan-Baharu-untuk-1-Mei)
- Fixed some Rumi (and Jawi) translations that didn't make it into 1.20.5 in time
- Ported some translation and the Three-Quarter High Hamza fixes from JawiCraft for the Jawi translations (1.19+ only)
  - To fully experience Jawi in versions before 1.19, download the full pack and apply it above the BetterMalay pack in the resource pack list (or below if you don't want to use the Jawi splash texts)
- Fixed a few typos in the translation
